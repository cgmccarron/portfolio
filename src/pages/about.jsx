        I have taken college courses for Computer Science. Although I did not
        finish, I have continued to learn and challenge myself to grow as a
        developer. I am passioate about clean and reusable code and creating
        cool stuff. Being mostly self taught as has pushed me to find creative
        solutions and really dig dip into learning new technology. I live in
        Texas, USA. Apart from programming, I enjoy cooking, playing fantasy
        football, and watching Marvel movies
